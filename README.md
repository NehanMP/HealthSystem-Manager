# HealthSystem-Manager
This project presents students with the challenge of designing and implementing a Health System API that addresses the complex requirements of modern healthcare management. The API will serve as the foundation upon which various healthcare applications and systems can be built, providing essential functionalities for patient management, appointment scheduling, medical record keeping, prescription management, and billing. It is also designed focusing on REST API design and implementation using JAX-RS. All functonalities must be carried out externally to send requests to the server (Postman, etc...) which includes adding Doctors and Patients first.
